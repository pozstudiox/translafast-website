  <!-- CONTENT -->
  <div class="privacy-container">
    <p>At TranslaFast, we are committed to protecting the privacy and data security of our users to the highest standard. This privacy policy provides a comprehensive explanation of how our extension works, how we approach user data, and what measures we take to protect it.</p>

    <h2>1. We Do Not Collect Any Data</h2>
    <p>The TranslaFast extension does not collect any personal data under any circumstances. We do not store names, emails, phone numbers, location data, IP addresses, device identifiers, or any other identity-related information. All translation processes occur entirely locally within the user's browser. No data is transmitted to our servers, nor is it analyzed or processed in any way.</p>
    <p>This approach not only fully meets users’ privacy expectations but also eliminates the risk of data breaches. You can use TranslaFast with complete peace of mind knowing your privacy is protected.</p>

    <h2>2. Translation Data Is Not Processed</h2>
    <p>All translation operations conducted through TranslaFast are processed temporarily in the browser’s memory only. The texts entered for translation are never sent to a server and are directly processed on the browser. Once the tab is closed, this data is automatically cleared from memory. Therefore, it is technically impossible for your content to fall into the hands of third parties.</p>
    <p>To guarantee data privacy, our extension does not include any software architecture that processes or stores data. After translation is completed, all user data is discarded.</p>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>TranslaFast never shares user data with third parties. Our extension is not integrated with ad networks, analytics services, data brokers, social media platforms, or any third-party service providers. Therefore, your data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising purposes.</p>
    <p>In line with our principles of transparency and commitment to user privacy, all user data remains under the full control of the user’s own browser.</p>

    <h2>4. Our Security Policy</h2>
    <p>TranslaFast operates strictly within the permissions granted by the browser and does not request any additional access without the user’s explicit consent. It does not access sensitive resources such as the camera, microphone, location, or file system. Our application code is regularly scanned to prevent malware, spyware, and data leaks.</p>
    <p>We follow open-source security standards and best practices throughout our development process and do not include any risky modules or plugins that could compromise user safety.</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Compliance (KVKK & GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Data protection regulations such as the Turkish Personal Data Protection Law (KVKK) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) impose obligations on organizations that process personal data. Since TranslaFast does not process any user data, it falls outside the scope of these obligations. However, in line with our commitment to user rights and transparency, we provide this detailed privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Should there be any changes due to legal regulations or technological developments, we will inform our users in a timely manner.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated or revised when necessary. Updates may occur due to the introduction of new security measures, compliance with legal regulations, or expansion of our services.</p>
    <p>All changes will be announced on this page along with the updated date. We recommend that users regularly visit this page to stay informed of the latest version.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights and Contact</h2>
    <p>If you would like to know more about our privacy policy, ask questions, or provide feedback, you are welcome to contact us. The communication channel below is actively monitored for all inquiries and feedback:</p>
    <p><a href="mailto:pozstudiosh@gmail.com">pozstudiosh@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>All inquiries are reviewed as soon as possible by our team, and we aim to provide solutions in line with our commitment to protecting your privacy.</p>
